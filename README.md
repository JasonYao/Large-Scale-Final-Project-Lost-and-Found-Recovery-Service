By Daniel Balagula, Chisom Mba, Avash Rao, Jason Yao

## Description

This repository is to contain all planning documents, the development pipeline setup scripts, along with the actual codebase for our application.

The application implements an anonymous lost & found service, where:

- Users can register to the site

- Users can register items they own

	- The application will create unique QR codes for them to print out and stick to their item

- If the object is lost & recovered, QR code can be scanned

	- application will be notified of event & who recovering party was

	- Application will coordinate return of the lost item (simulated)

## Goals

Our final project in CSCI-UA 480 Large Scalability, in which our goals are to:

- Create a full-fledged scalable web application

- Showcase security & scalability in design & planning of application
